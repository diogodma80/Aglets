Mobile agents are programs able to migrate through a heterogeneous network, from one
node to another, with the intent to perform a given task which they were programmed to. The project presents an intrusion detection system tool implemented with a mobile agent framework.
This system consists on creating a log analyser agent that is sent to various web servers and
whose task is search system attack attempts. For this purpose, pattern filtering techniques were
implemented to detect known types of attacks and the artificial ignorance technique was used to
detect possible unknown log entries. Although access to real log files from web servers are kept
private, the tests performed were successful in finding all malicious log entries as well as those
that were suspicious.
